### 1. The Core Philosophy

- **“Your mind is for big‑picture thinking.”**  
    Keep your brain free of clutter by moving every commitment to a reliable external system.
- **“Work in the present, not in the past.”**  
    Focus on _what to do now_, not on “what I should have done yesterday.”

### 2. The Five Workflow Stages

|Stage|What It Means|Key Questions|
|---|---|---|
|**Collect**|Capture _everything_ that’s on your mind.|“What are the items that demand my attention?”|
|**Process**|Decide the next action for each item.|“Is it actionable? If so, what’s the very next physical step?”|
|**Organize**|Store decisions in the right lists.|“Where should this item belong (Next Actions, Projects, Waiting‑For, Someday‑Maybe, Calendar)?”|
|**Review**|Weekly audit of the system.|“Is the list up‑to‑date? Are priorities correct?”|
|**Do**|Execute the actions.|“Which next action is most appropriate right now?”|

### 3. The 5 Core Tools

|Tool|Purpose|How to Use|
|---|---|---|
|**Inbox**|All incoming items.|Empty it _every day_ by moving items to Process.|
|**Next Actions**|Concrete, single‑step tasks.|List them in a “Next Actions” list; they’re what you actually do.|
|**Projects**|Anything that needs more than one step.|Keep a separate “Projects” list; every project has at least one Next Action.|
|**Waiting‑For**|Tasks you’ve delegated.|Store the contact and the deliverable; review monthly to follow up.|
|**Someday‑Maybe**|Ideas that aren’t urgent.|Keep a list of “Someday” items; review them occasionally.|

### 4. The 2‑Minute Rule

If an action can be done in **≤ 2 minutes**, do it immediately.

- _Why it works_: Eliminates the “I’ll do it later” trap and keeps the system lean.

---
### 5. Contextual Lists (or “Contexts”)

Group Next Actions by _where/what_ they need to be done:

- **@home, @office, @computer, @phone, @errand, etc.**  
    When you’re in a particular environment, open only the matching context list.

---
### 5. The “In‑Progress” Lists

- **“Someday‑Maybe”** – ideas that could become projects.
- **“Next Actions”** – all actionable items.
- **“Waiting‑For”** – delegated items.
- **“Projects”** – multi‑step commitments.
- **Calendar** – time‑specific actions (deadlines, meetings).

---

### 5. Weekly Review (The “GTD Weekly Review”)

1. **Empty the inbox** (collect).
2. **Process everything** in your inbox, “Waiting‑For”, “Someday‑Maybe”.
3. **Update Projects** – confirm next actions, adjust timelines.
4. **Check Calendar** – verify you have no missed commitments.
5. **Reset the next‑action lists** – ensure the most relevant tasks are front‑and‑center.

_Result:_ A clear, actionable set of priorities for the week ahead.

---
### 5. The “Context‑Based Doing”

- **Focus on _What?_ + _Where?_**  
    When you’re ready to work, pick the next action that fits the context (e.g., a phone call while you’re at the desk).
- **The “Two‑Minute Review”** – check all lists to see if anything needs attention before you start your primary task.

---

### 6. GTD in Action – a Typical Day

1. **Morning** – Quick 5‑minute “brain dump” → move all items into the Inbox.
2. **Mid‑morning** – Process the inbox (apply 2‑min rule, decide Next Actions).
3. **During work** – Pull from the context‑specific Next Actions list; switch tasks only when the current one is truly finished.
4. **End‑of‑day** – Empty the Inbox again; ensure no new items are left.
5. **Weekly** – Run the full audit; refresh the system.

### 7. Common Mistakes & Fixes

|Mistake|Fix|
|---|---|
|**Leaving the Inbox full**|Empty it daily; use a physical or digital “Collect” tray.|
|**Not defining “Next Action”**|Always ask “What is the next physical step?” even if it’s a simple click.|
|**Mixing projects with Next Actions**|Keep a clear Projects list; each project must have at least one actionable next step.|
|**Skipping the Weekly Review**|It’s the only time you get a _big‑picture_ view; treat it as a non‑negotiable meeting with yourself.|

---

### 8. Bottom‑Line Takeaways

|Takeaway|Practical Impact|
|---|---|
|_Externalize everything_|Your mind stays clear for strategic thinking.|
|_Decide the next action immediately_|No “later” or “later‑later” traps.|
|_Organize by context & priority_|Quickly find what to do next, no more “I’m not sure what to do.”|
|_Review regularly_|Keeps your system accurate and your priorities honest.|
|_Act on the most relevant next step_|Moves you forward without analysis paralysis.|

### 9. Quick‑Start Cheat Sheet

1. **Set up your GTD toolset** (Inbox, Next Actions, Projects, Waiting‑For, Someday‑Maybe).
2. **Collect every incoming item** → move to the Inbox.
3. **Process 2‑minute items immediately**; for others, decide “Action / Delay / Delegate / Eliminate.”
4. **Add actionable items to Next Actions**; non‑actionable items go to the appropriate list.
5. **Do** – use the context‑based approach; if you’re not sure, choose the “most appropriate” next action.
6. **Review** – once a week, update all lists, check on waiting‑for, and refresh project next actions.

**Getting Things Done** is not a set of arbitrary rules; it’s a _complete workflow_ that lets you:

- Capture _all_ commitments reliably,
- Decide _exactly_ what to do next,
- Store that decision in the right place,
- Review the system weekly, and
- Act on the next step with confidence.

Once you master the flow, the system “just works” and frees your mental bandwidth for creative, strategic work.
