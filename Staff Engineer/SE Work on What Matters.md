4hrs / Week to Look to the Future / Strategize
4 Hrs / Week to build / develop the team around me
2Hrs/ week to REFLECT on those two things and get more efficient in them


- Is this task low effort, low impact? DON'T DO IT!
- Is this a problem we know we have, or one we think we have? INVESTIGATE with caution!
- Address any issues that may impact the EXISTENCE of your company, and then your organization! You can't help a company that does not exist, and if your org is threatened... so are you. So save it, or start looking to migrate! This is **always*** first priority.
- Work where there's room AND attention.
	- What will become critical in the future, where we can do great work ahead of time?
	- What is **okay*** but could be GREAT! with my support?
	- Developer tooling work is always a good bet... but be careful because it must always be maintained.
	- Teach the company to value something it doesn't care about.
- Foster Growth in the Team Around You - often underinvested in
	- A few hours a week here can have tremendous ripples
- Edit
	- Some projects are a small change/course correction from success.
	- Call this out or connect resources, then leave it be for someone else to solve.
- Finish things!
	- Is something on the team just dragging along? Get it off the books. This is very similar to the above.
- What ONLY YOU CAN
	- Not things that you are faster or better at... but work that SIMPLY WONT HAPPEN if you don't do it.
	- Intersection of what you are exceptionally good at, and what you actually care about
- WHY IT MATTERS
	- Twenty years into your career, interviewers will not understand the real impact of any previous projecs
	- Instead you will be measured by
		- prestice
		- titles and companies
		- backchannel (street cred) reputation
		- how you present in the interview
