Operating at Staff

Work on what matters
- Find energizing work, not necessarily just impactful [Pacing Your Career to your life](https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/)
	- Focus on Pace, People, Prestige, Profit, and Learning
	- Pace
		- [avoid burnout](https://aprilwensel.medium.com/only-you-can-prevent-tech-burnout-be3f0504c627)
		- 50% work on work you find meaningful, 50% manage the pace
		- "There is, however, a simple formula for checking if what you’re doing is sustainable: how long does it take on a vacation or weekend until you stop feeling anxious, and how anxious do you start feeling when you think about returning to work on Monday? If work anxiety is a constant companion, then change your situation even if it feels like a step back in the short-term: your success depends on sustained impact, not spikes"
	- People
		- People contribute to work enjoyment and have an outsized influence on your career long after you've stopped working together
		- The refer you for positions, give advice on difficult situations, and will be advisors or investors in your startup if you choose to start one.
		- Not noted in the book, but you will likely attend each others weddings and big days if they are truly great people.
		-  **I need to focus on NETWORKING internally and externally***
	- Prestige
		- Prestige can be earned quickly or with slow, deliberate hard work.
		- Prestige is a universal lubricant.
	- Profit
		- Pretty much do what I am doing with FIRE as it is.
		- Financial Security is a prerequisite to own your pace and learning
	- Learning
		- Every week, spend FOUR HOURS thinking about the future.
		- In hypergrowth roles... there is often little time for the above reflecion.
		- Learn deep (mastery) vs. learning broad (awareness, and gaining access to the masters should you need them)
		- Learning doesn't always come from doing new things. It also comes from reflecting on how you did new things and what you might change. We need this time to reflect, so MANAGE YOUR PACE!
- There are a few ways to get "distracted" - snacking, preening, and chasing ghosts
- **Snacking** - low effort, low impact work that feels good psychologically. You are unlikely to learn much from doing this, others are capable of completing this, and it may even be a good learning opportunity for them! Minimize this work as a "reward" or break between harder items, especially as you manage your own workflow.
	- Low effort, high impact work becomes scarce as an organization matures. This is why new teams/companies can be exciting! But be wary as you gain a foothold.
- **Preening**  is a subset of snacking, with a focus on *high visibility* low impact, easy work.
	- "If a company's leadership consiste entirely of folks who focus their energy on performative urgency or acts of fealty, don't be surprised when your success in the company depends on those activities"
- **Stop Chasing Ghosts**
	- Take time to understand the status quo before shifting it
	- leadership may "know" things to be true that were once true, and simply aren't real anymore
