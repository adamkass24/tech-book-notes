- Operable code has built in protection, diagnostics, and controls.
- Defensive programming - safe code takes advantage of compile-time validation to prevent runtime falures.
	- Resilient code uses exception-handling best practices and handles failures gracefully
	- Avoid null values
		- especially as outputs of functions
	- Make variables immutable
		- `final` in java
		- `val` instead of `var` in scala
		- `let` in rust instead of `let mut`
		- In python, consider making [[data classes]] immutable!
	- Use type hinting and static type checkers
	- Validate inputs
		- reject bad input as early as possible!0
