	- A Map for Your Journey
		- Peak Newb
			- Get familiar with company and team / process
			- Set up dev environment and access
			- Read docs and initial 1:1's with teammates
			- Fill in documentation gaps as you complete onboarding
			- Use the IDE your team uses. If you don't know it, invest in tutorials.
			- Configure your IDE to team code formatting conventions - ask what they are, import config if possible or ask how to apply them
			- Get added by manager to team / company meetings and stand ups
		- Ramp-Up River
			- Gain access to codebase. Look at pull requests and reviews, focus on top recent contributors. Be skeptical but eager
			- Sign up for tech talks, brown bags, reading groups, and mentorship programs
		- Cape Contributor
			- Deploying production-grade code and testing well
			- You are now helping teammates
		- Operations Ocean
			- Testing
			- Build
			- Release
			- Deployment
			- Rollout
			- Debug live software using metrics, logs, and trace tools
			- This is the point where you enter on-call
		- Competence Cove
			- You will write technical design docs and help with project planning
			- Explore trade-offs and plan for your system to evolve over time
			- Learn to balance regular work with necessary maintenance and refactoring
- Getting to Conscious Competence
	- Four stages: Martin M. Broadwell, "Teaching for Learning"
		- Unconscious incompetence
			- unable to perform task correctly, unaware of gap
		- Conscious Incompetence
			- unable to do, aware of gap
		- Conscious Competence
			- can perform task with effort
		- Unconscious Competence
			- can perform task effortlessly
	- Learning to Learn
		- Front-Load Your Learning
			- Spend first few months on the job learning how everything works (i need to go back and do this)
			- Start with your domain - then look to the upstream and downstream
			- Even when you want to get your hands dirty - this is an investment that is worthwhile
		- Learn by Doing
			- Even while reading docs, make sure to do SOMETHING! Know the impact of your work
			- ex. write a unit test instead of updating an index on a high traffic database
		- Experiment with Code
			- Run experiments to see how code works or fails
		- Read
			- Don't try to read everything at once, start with team docs and design documents.
				- pay attention to discussions on trade-offs
			- read YOUR codebase as well as high quality open source code
			- Read through pending tickets and issues to see what everyone is working on and what is coming up
				- backlog is good source for newbie projects too
				- Join a reading group!
				- 
		- Watch Presentations
		- Attend Meetups and Conferences (Sparingly)
		- Shadow and Pair with Experienced Engineers
			- open source is a great candidate, but be careful about what you work on during company time!
		- Experiment with Side Projects
	- Asking Questions
		- Do Your Research
		- Timebox
		- Show Your Work
		- Don't Interrupt
		- Prefer Multicast, Asynchronous Communication
		- Batch your Synchronous Requests
	- Overcoming Growth Obstacles
		- Imposter Syndrome
		- The Dunning-Kruger Effect
	- Do's and Don'ts
	- Level Up
- Working with Code
	- Fancy new frameworks are cool, but boring tech is good. Their failure modes are well known by many!
