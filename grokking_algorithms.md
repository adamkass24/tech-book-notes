- Goals
	- Foundation for rest of the book
	- Write your first search algorithm (binary search)
	- Learn how to talk about the running time of an algorithm (Big O notation)
- Sometimes using a different data structure can make a big difference
- Learn to make a recommendations system using k-nearsest neighbors (KNN)
- Some problem's aren't solvable in a timely manner! In that case, approximate
- Binary Search
	- input is a sorted list of elements... very important that it is sorted
	- For any list of n, binary search will take log(sub2)n steps to run
	- Simple search takes n steps
	- Logs are the inverse of exponentials
